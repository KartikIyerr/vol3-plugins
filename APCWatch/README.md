# APCWatch Plugin Documentation

## Overview

The **APCWatch** plugin for Volatility 3 is designed to detect and analyze Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) within a Windows memory image. APCs are functions scheduled to execute asynchronously in the context of a specific thread, either in user mode or kernel mode. They are commonly used for legitimate purposes but can also be exploited by malicious actors for process injection and code execution.

## Purpose

The primary goal of APCWatch is to identify and enumerate APCs across all processes in a Windows memory dump. By analyzing APCs, investigators can uncover potential indicators of compromise, such as unauthorized code execution or process manipulation. This plugin aids in detecting both system-generated and user-generated APCs, providing insights into the execution flow within the system.

## Functionality

APCWatch operates by traversing the list of processes and their associated threads, extracting detailed information about each APC found. For each APC, the plugin retrieves:

- **Process Name**: The name of the process containing the APC.
- **PID (Process ID)**: The unique identifier of the process.
- **TID (Thread ID)**: The unique identifier of the thread associated with the APC.
- **KernelRoutine**: The address of the kernel-mode APC routine.
- **NormalRoutine**: The address of the user-mode APC routine.
- **APCMode**: Indicates whether the APC is kernel-mode or user-mode.
- **Inserted**: Flag indicating if the APC is currently inserted in the APC queue.
- **KernelAPC**: Flag indicating if a kernel-mode APC is in progress.
- **SpecialAPC**: Flag indicating if a special APC is in progress.
- **KernelAPCPending**: Flag indicating if a kernel-mode APC is pending.
- **UserAPCPending**: Flag indicating if a user-mode APC is pending.

This data that is shown to the user facilitates the detection of anomalous or unauthorized APCs that may signify malicious activity.

## Usage

To utilize the APCWatch plugin, execute the following command within the Volatility 3 framework:


```bash
volatility3 -f [memory_dump] windows.apcwatch.APCWatch
```

Replace `[memory_dump]` with the path to your Windows memory image. The plugin will process the image and display a table of detected APCs, including the details mentioned above.

## Requirements

APCWatch requires the following:

- **Volatility 3 Framework**: Version 2.4.0 or higher.
- **Windows Kernel Module**: The memory image must include the Windows kernel module for accurate analysis.

These requirements ensure that APCWatch can effectively parse and analyze the necessary structures within the memory image.

## Development and Contribution

APCWatch was developed to enhance memory forensics capabilities within the Volatility 3 framework. Its focus on APC analysis provides a valuable tool for identifying sophisticated malware techniques that exploit Windows' asynchronous execution mechanisms.

Contributions to APCWatch are welcome. To contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the Volatility 3 repository.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Develop your changes in a dedicated branch.
3. **Implement Changes**: Add or modify code as necessary, ensuring adherence to coding standards.
4. **Write Tests**: Develop tests to validate your changes.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Propose your changes for inclusion in the main repository.

Detailed guidelines for contributing can be found in the Volatility 3 contribution documentation.
